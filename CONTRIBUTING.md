## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

**Code Style:**
- Follow existing C# conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and concise

**Testing:**
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Update existing tests if behavior changes
- Ensure all tests pass: `dotnet test`

**Commits:**
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use conventional commits format:
  ```
  feat: add support for Card item types
  fix: resolve namespace creation race condition
  docs: update configuration examples
  test: add integration tests for SSH keys
  refactor: simplify secret sanitization logic
  ```

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific test
dotnet test --filter "DisplaySpectreConsoleSummaryDemo"

# Test with dry run
SYNC__DRYRUN=true dotnet run sync

# Build Docker image
docker build -t vaultwarden-k8s-sync:test ./VaultwardenK8sSync

# Test in Kubernetes (if available)
kubectl set image deployment/vaultwarden-k8s-sync \
  vaultwarden-k8s-sync=vaultwarden-k8s-sync:test
```

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a PR on GitHub:
- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Link related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Add screenshots/logs if relevant
- Mark as draft if work-in-progress

**What Happens Next:**
- Automated tests run (build, unit tests, security checks)
- A Docker image is built for your PR (tagged as `pr-XXX-XXXXXXXX`)
- Maintainers review your code
- You may be asked to make changes
- Once approved, your PR will be merged! 🎉

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with coverage (if configured)
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "KubernetesServiceTests"
```

### Integration Testing

Create a test environment:

```bash
# 1. Start a local Kubernetes cluster
kind create cluster --name vw-test

# 2. Set up test Vaultwarden instance (or use existing)
# 3. Configure .env with test credentials
# 4. Run sync
SYNC__DRYRUN=true dotnet run sync
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Sync creates new secrets correctly
- [ ] Sync updates existing secrets when items change
- [ ] Orphan cleanup removes old secrets
- [ ] Dry run mode doesn't modify anything
- [ ] Multiple namespaces work correctly
- [ ] Custom field names are respected
- [ ] Error handling works (invalid credentials, missing namespace, etc.)
- [ ] Logs are clear and helpful

## 📋 Code Review Guidelines

### What We Look For

**Functionality:**
- Does it solve the problem?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling robust?

**Code Quality:**
- Is it readable and maintainable?
- Are there tests?
- Is it well-documented?

**Performance:**
- Does it impact sync speed?
- Are there unnecessary API calls?
- Is memory usage reasonable?

**Security:**
- Are secrets handled safely?
- Is input validated?
- Are dependencies up-to-date?

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks** - Must pass before human review
   - Build succeeds
   - Tests pass
   - No TODO/FIXME comments
   - Helm chart validates
   - No vulnerable dependencies

2. **Code Review** - Maintainer feedback
   - Functionality review
   - Code quality assessment
   - Suggestions for improvement

3. **Approval & Merge**
   - At least one maintainer approval required
   - All conversations resolved
   - Squash and merge (usually)

### Key Components

**SyncService** - Core sync logic
- Fetches items from Vaultwarden
- Transforms to Kubernetes secrets
- Handles create/update/delete operations

**KubernetesService** - K8s interactions
- Secret CRUD operations
- Namespace validation
- Label-based filtering

**VaultwardenService** - Vaultwarden integration
- Authenticates via bw-cli
- Fetches and filters items
- Handles organization/collection scoping

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

We use **Spectre.Console** for beautiful terminal output:

- Use colors meaningfully (green=success, yellow=warning, red=error)
- Keep output concise but informative
- Support both interactive and CI/CD environments
- Provide progress indicators for long operations
- Make errors actionable (tell users how to fix)

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

**When Contributing:**

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use `.env` files (gitignored)
2. **Validate all input** - Especially from Vaultwarden items
3. **Use secure defaults** - Fail closed, not open
4. **Log carefully** - Never log passwords or sensitive data
5. **Update dependencies** - Keep packages current
6. **Follow least privilege** - Request minimal K8s permissions

**Reporting Security Issues:**

If you discover a security vulnerability:
- **DO NOT** open a public issue
- Email the maintainers directly (see README)
- Provide details and steps to reproduce
- Allow time for a fix before public disclosure
